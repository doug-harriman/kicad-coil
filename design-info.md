# General Design Data

## Magnets
6mm dia x 2mm thick disk magnet, axially magnetized.

Max field (at surface, center)
- N35 - 3355 GS (82% of N52)
- N42 - 3660 GS (89% of N52)
- N52 - 4100 GS

### Hall Effect Sensors

Sensitivity
- A1302: 1.3 mV/GS -> 13 mV/mT
- 49E: 1.6 mV/GS -> 16 mV/mT

> **Note** 
>
> Units: 1 mT = 10 G

Voltage measurement range: Â±2.5V off of a 2.5V nominal output with no field.

## Coil
- FEMM estimates ~3.5 mT for a single coil, 1 mm deep, 1A current 
- Center coil dia is ~1.4 mm across
- Was running stepper driver at 600 mA
- MagPyLib was estimating 2x coils (top + bottom) => ~2x the field.

### Trace Width Limits

Copper weight an min trace thickness & spacing (same value) per [PCB Way](https://www.pcbway.com/).

|0.5|	3|
|1|	3|
|2|	6.5|
|3|	10|
|4|	13|
|5|18|
|6|18|

There are various PCB trace temperature rise calculators available that take track width, copper thickness and trace current as inputs.  Good information from Proto Express:

## Design Questions

- [ ] FEMM model prediction for force for unit depth rectangular circuit.
- [ ] Trade curves for different PCB geometry (id, od, trace width/spacing) based on available magnet sizes.
- [ ] FEMM model field vs. Hall measured field -> first pass geometric field correction factor.
    - Geometric errors
        - Magnets are round
        - Coil conductors are parallel to each other for maximum packing factor, but do not intersect the center of rotation.
        - Could update FEMM model to look at tangential slice => each coil would have different width and spacing.
    - Future: ELMER for true geometric impact assessment.
- [ ] Hall measured field for magnets, estimate magnet type based on field & distance.
- [ ] Optimal magnet spacing (tangentially) for rotor to inform next design.
- [ ] What are limits on copper thickness vs. PCB thickness vs. trace width.
