# KiCAD Plugins

[Curated list of Plugins](https://github.com/joanbono/awesome-kicad)

* [Interactive HTML BOM](https://github.com/openscopeproject/InteractiveHtmlBom) - BOM list _and_ board view, with highlighting of the PBC comonents on the board when the BOM item is selected in the list.
* [Board2Pdf](https://gitlab.com/dennevi/Board2Pdf/) - Finer control of Board (i.e. layout, not schematic) PDF generation.
* [KiCAD Teardrops](https://github.com/stimulu/kicad-teardrops)
    * Converts vias to teardrop vias.  
    * Provides a GUI.
    * Might also be a good source for understanding how someone else generated code.
